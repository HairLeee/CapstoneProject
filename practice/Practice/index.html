      <strong>Seoul, South Korea CNN —</strong>
      For the first time in decades a US soldier is believed to be in North
      Korean custody. That is a scenario that could cause a diplomatic headache
      for the United States while it, alongside ally South Korea, tries to keep
      pressure on Pyongyang as the isolated nation ramps up its ballistic
      missile tests and bellicose rhetoric.

      The US Army has identified the soldier who crossed the demarcation line
      into North Korea on Tuesday as Pvt. Travis King.

    <p>
      US military officials say King “willfully and without authorization”
      crossed into North Korea while taking a civilian tour of the Joint
      Security Area, a small collection of ​buildings inside the 150-mile-long
      demilitarized zone (DMZ) that has separated North and South Korea since
      the end of the Korean War in 1953. “We believe he is currently in
      (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) custody and are working with our
      (Korean People’s Army) counterparts to resolve this incident,” US Forces
      Korea spokesperson Col. Isaac Taylor said in a statement. Here’s what we
      know so far.
