      US military officials say King “willfully and without authorization”
      crossed into North Korea while taking a civilian tour of the Joint
      Security Area, a small collection of ​buildings inside the 150-mile-long
      demilitarized zone (DMZ) that has separated North and South Korea since
      the end of the Korean War in 1953. “We believe he is currently in
      (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) custody and are working with our
      (Korean People’s Army) counterparts to resolve this incident,” US Forces
      Korea spokesperson Col. Isaac Taylor said in a statement. Here’s what we
